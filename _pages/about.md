Thanks for visiting and your interest in learning more about me! I created this website to show my existitence on earth. There are mainly two parts you can find in this website: 1) basic info: read this part if you want to hire me; 2) my reading notes and personally opinions: read this part if you want to know me and maybe date me :). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any comments or suggestions.

Research
======
During my PhD, I merged machine learning with physics for chemical adsorption studies in Metal-Organic Frameworks. Now, I'm applying data science to combination drug product development.

I'm passionate about energy (renewables, carbon capture), health (drug discovery, and manufacturing!), and AI (from optimization to applications). Talk me in exploring these dynamic fields!

Hobbies
======
In the past, my interests included video games (not the best gamer, but maybe a bit of a toxic one) and mountain biking.

Currently on the quest to discover new everyday passion, I've been experimenting with various activities. Recently, I took up figure skating, proudly achieving adult level-1 after six months (which essentially means I won't fall on the ice!). A month-long stint in singing lessons added a melodious touch to my pursuits. Exploring frisbee skills, I even completed a game season, though mostly as a bench player. The adventure continues as I search for that perfect everyday hobby!
